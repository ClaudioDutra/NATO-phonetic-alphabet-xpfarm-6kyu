# Notes

The NATO phonetic alphabet is a Spelling Alphabet, a set of words used instead of letters in oral communication (i.e. over the phone or military radio). Each word ("code word") stands for its initial letter (alphabetical "symbol"). The 26 code words in the NATO phonetic alphabet are assigned to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in alphabetical order

## Task

You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet).

### Input

`If, you can read?`

### Output

`India Foxtrot , Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta ?`

## Rules to be considered

- The set of used punctuation is `,.!?`.
- Punctuation should be kept in your return string, but spaces should not.
- Xray should not have a dash within.
- Every word and punctuation mark should be seperated by a space ' '.
- There should be no trailing whitespace
